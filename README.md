# PoolProducts

A concept design for a proposed overhaul to an existing company's website.
The purpose is to :
- Improve sales by making the cart more visible and to appear more like a shop
- Improve website views, especially in smaller screens
- Alter menu displays
- Condense the number of pages to reduce the navigation bar taking up too much space

Update : 
The client was happy with the existing proposal and wanted to integrate this into Shopify. Code Extracts from this propsal were taken and added to the Shopify development store. 

To view the website before the changes - all screenshots are inside the "before_images" folder.
